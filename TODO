Listen for new connections
- Accept new connections, hand off to handler

while True:
	listen()

handler():
	TLS Handshake
	
	request = ""
	for char in listen():
		request.append(char)
		if char == LF && request[-2] == CR:
			request[-2] = \0
			break
	
	find url
	determine response code / header string / body

	send(response code + " " + response header string + CRLF)
